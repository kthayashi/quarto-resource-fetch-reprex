title: Load image (v1)
---

```{r}
#| label: check

getwd()

file.exists("images/img.png")
```

The image cannot be fetched during render:

```{r}
#| label: load-image

knitr::include_graphics("images/img.png")
```

Markdown syntax can work but requires relative path from document.

Path from project root fails:

![](images/img.png)

Relative path from document works:

![](../images/img.png)

But data can be loaded with path from project root:

```{r}
df <- read.csv("data/df.csv")
head(df)
```
