title: Load image (v2)
---

```{r}
#| label: check

getwd()

file.exists("images/img.png")
```

Copying the directory containing the image from the project root to the directory containing the render targets is necessary to make the image available during render, despite setting `execute-dir: project`:

```{r}
#| label: load-image

file.copy("images", "qmd", recursive = TRUE)
knitr::include_graphics("images/img.png")
```
